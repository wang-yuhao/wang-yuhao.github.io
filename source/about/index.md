What is the essence of the brain and mind? How do we define intelligence? Is it only related to memory and learning? Can it be cultivated or enhanced, or are we bound by predetermined capacities? These questions have intrigued me since childhood. As I progressed through my education and career, I encountered some individuals who navigate complex concepts and produce groundbreaking innovations with remarkable ease.

Policies can redistribute resources, but they cannot elevate anyone's intellectual potential. Simultaneously, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence raises pressing questions: as AI systems surpass human capabilities in specific domains, how can we use new technology to ensure human existence remains necessary?
