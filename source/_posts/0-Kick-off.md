Welcome to Yuhaoâ€™s Blog!

There are always many people who think they are very special, unique and important. I am very happy to be able to visit many places in the world, meet many people from different cultures and different classes, and also absorb some professional knowledge or common sense from books, courses or the Internet.

With these, I can understand the world more clearly. It also makes it harder to try to fool or control me.

But most importantly, as I grew up, I became more and more convinced:

```
Everyone is equal.
Time and freedom are most important.
```
