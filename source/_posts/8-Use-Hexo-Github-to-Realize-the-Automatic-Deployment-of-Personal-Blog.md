Recently the computer was broken, so all study resources were lost, and before I didn't like to backup files, I had to learn to build a personal blog with Hexo and Github. Write this file, so last time will not waste too much time to redo the same things as today.

#### Learn Hexo Blog Framework(On Ubuntu):
1.1 install hexo: `npm install -g hexo`
1.2 Initlize hexo: `hexo init`

1.5 Open `localhost:4000` in browser.
