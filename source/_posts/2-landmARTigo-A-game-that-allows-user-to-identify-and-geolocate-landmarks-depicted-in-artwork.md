This project draft envisions the human computation system landmARTigo that leverages the human perception and knowledge of real users to identify landmarks that might
be depicted in artworks. The system is similar to the ESP game, ARTigo and Karido. To incentivize users, we elaborated several benefits for users and stakeholders. We also developed a concept for the user interface. The draft includes a model for data processing and the algorithms involved in the human computation system. The system has to deal with the cold-start problem, which we want to mitigate with several solutions. We devised metrics for evaluation and how to execute the evaluation. For future work, there are several extensions we came up with, that are possible, if the system is successful.
